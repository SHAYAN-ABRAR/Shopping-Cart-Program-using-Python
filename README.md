# Shopping Cart - Python

## Description
This Python program allows users to build a virtual shopping cart by entering food items and their corresponding prices. The user can keep adding items until they enter "q" to quit. Afterward, the program displays all items in the cart and calculates the total price.

## Features
- Continuously prompts the user to enter food items and their prices.
- Stores food names and prices in separate lists for easy tracking.
- Calculates the total cost of all items in the cart.
- Displays the cart items and the total cost at the end.

## How to Use
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Run the `shopping_cart_program.py` file in a Python environment.
3. Follow the prompts:
   - Enter a food item to add to the cart (or type "q" to quit).
   - Enter the price of each item.
4. Once you type "q" to quit, the program will display:
   - A list of all the items in your cart.
   - The total cost of all items.
